                <p>
                     Hello! I'm Moorthi Dharmaraj, <br>a self-taught web developer with a passion for turning ideas into digital experiences. My journey in web development began with a curiosity to understand how websites work, and it has evolved into a continuous exploration of new technologies and creative solutions.
                    I specialize in crafting responsive and user-friendly web applications, always striving for clean code and elegant design. My approach to development involves a balance between functionality and aesthetics, with a keen eye for detail.
                    When I'm not coding, you'll find me experimenting with new frameworks, contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying a cup of coffee while sketching out new project ideas. I believe in the power of collaboration and enjoy being part of a community that shares knowledge and pushes the boundaries of what can be achieved on the web.
                    Feel free to explore my portfolio and discover the projects that reflect my dedication to the world of web development. If you have any questions or would like to connect, I'm just a message away. Let's create something amazing together!        
                    Remember, these are just starting points, and you should tailor them to better represent your unique background and aspirations. Good luck with your portfolio development!
